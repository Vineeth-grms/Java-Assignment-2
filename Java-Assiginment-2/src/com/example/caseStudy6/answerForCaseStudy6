git revert
git revert creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by a specific commit. 
This is useful when you want to maintain the history of changes but correct a specific
 mistake.
Usage:

git revert <commit-hash>

Advantages:

Preserves History: The revert operation is recorded as a new commit, so the project’s
 history remains intact and transparent.
 
Safe for Shared Repositories: Since it adds a new commit, it doesn’t rewrite the commit
 history, making it safe to use in shared branches (e.g., main, develop).
